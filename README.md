##  Flash Cards

This is the starter repository for the [Flash Cards](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards) project.
Hi! Welcome to my FlashCards project. This is a simple command-line game I created to practice Ruby and object-oriented programming. The game is designed to simulate flashcards, where you answer questions, get feedback, and see how well you did at the end.

I also learned how to load questions dynamically from a text file, making the game super flexible. Let me show you how it works!

What's in this Project?
Flashcards: Each card has a question, an answer, and a category.
Gameplay: You play through a deck of cards, answer questions, and get immediate feedback.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your correct answers and shows a breakdown by category at the end.
Dynamic Questions: Flashcards are loaded from a .txt file, so you can change the questions without touching the code.
